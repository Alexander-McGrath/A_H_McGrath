I have studied ecology in systems ranging from ticks to limpets and most recently habitat forming macroalgae. My work uses manipulative field and mesocosm experiments to explore the role of host-associated microbes in host function and fitness. Outside of the lab you can find me either in the pottery studio or with my head stuck in a rockpool looking for critters.
