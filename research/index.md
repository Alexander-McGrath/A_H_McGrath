My research Leverages ecological theory within holobiont systems to determine cause-effect relationships within a changing environment. Currently I am conducting experiments aimed at disentangling the effect of host genotype versus microbiome in host function and fitness.

I am interested generally in Ecology, Microbiology, and evolutionary biology.
