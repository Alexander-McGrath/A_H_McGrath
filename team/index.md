Marine ecologist and microbiologist from the UK who is slightly obsessed with marine macrophytes. I have studied ecology in systems ranging from ticks to limpets and most recently habitat forming macroalgae. My work uses manipulative field and mesocosm experiments to explore the role of host-associated microbes in host function and fitness. Outside of the lab you can find me either in the pottery studio or with my head stuck in a rockpool looking for critters.

**Research Fellow** 

2024 – Present – Universita di Pisa -
I am currently a research fellow in the Marine Ecology and Biology research unit at the Universita di Pisa. 

**PhD Candidate** 

2020 -2023 – The University of Sydney -
My PhD research leveraged ecological theory to study host-microbe interactions and their causative effect on host and ecosystem 
function in non-model systems
